 59 year-old male emergently taken to or under general anesthesia for left subdural hemorrhage evacuation following fall at home on <date>.pateint monitored in the trauma icu both by neurosurgery and trauma team for management. postoperatively patient developed a pneumocephalusreceived fio2 100% for 24 hours and kept flat. patient slowly but gradually showed improvement on his neurologic status. post op patient able to follow commands moving his all extremities confused at times. patient received antibiotic x3 doses postop prophylactically. patient extuabted <date>. sputum culture on <date> grew gram neg rods and gram pos cocci so pt. was started on levaquin on <date>. he spiked a fever 101.6 f pod#2 remained febrile several days so far fever workup including blood cultres multiple chest xrays lft's (<date>) and le doppler for dvt (<date>) has been negative. patient transferred to neurosurgery stepdown unit on <date>. id consulted for persistent fever no source identified yet but for the possibility of coag negative staph sinusitis he had finished a fourteen day course of levaquin by the day of discharge. left eye ecchymosis improving. ent also consulted to r/o sinusitis and fever they recommended to continue with levaquin keep npo high risk for aspiration afrin and ocean spray started <date>. plastic also consulted for multiple sinus fractures. ethmoid sinus fluid culture was positive for coag negative staph considered either a contaminant or the source of the fever. no surgical intervention was offered at present by plastic surgery but the patient may have elective repair at later date if patient desires. patient underwent speech & swallow evaluation <date>. initial evaluation was indeterminant and a f/u video swallow study was performed <date> which was negative for aspiration with honey thick liquids (silent aspirations with thin & nectar thick liquids). diet recommendations were for honey thick liquids ground solids and medicines crushed in applesauce. reevaluation for nectar thick liquids may be performed at later date while in rehab. patient tolerated diet well. of note when the team attempted to discontinue the foley catheter the patient developed urinary retention; a straight catheter was reinserted on several attempts but with persistently high pvls a foley catheter eventually had to be replaced ad he was discharged with this. physical therapy consulted for safety and ambulation felt to be he would benefit from rehab stay. on the day of discharge he was feeling well; he had persistent difficulties with speech but was moving all extremities was oob to chair with assist. 


==============================================================
============================================================== pt was evaluated in the <entity> emergency department. his complex lip laceration was repaired by plastic and reconstructive surgery. neurosurgery was consulted for pneumocephalus and cribriform plate fracture. they recommended treating with vanco gentamicin and flagyl and monitoring for csf leak. he was taken to the or with orthopaedic surgery on hd2 for orif of right elbow fracture-dislocation and closed reduction w/external fixator placement for his left distal radius fracture. postoperatively the patient was febrile to 105. lumbar puncture was performed by trauma team (final results were negative). he was started on cefazolin flagyl and zosyn. he remained intubated in the pacu overnight. he was transferred to the trauma sicu and was extubated on hd4. he was transferred to the floor on hd5 and his diet was advanced. the patient worked with physical and occupational therapy who cleared him to go home. he was taken to the operating room with plastic and reconstructive surgery on <date> for open reduction and internal fixation of his <name> and palate fractures. he was stable posoperatively. 


==============================================================
============================================================== mr <name> was admitted to the micu for one day for monitoring after his tips procedure. he remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughot his stay. he was to be transferred to the floor the morning following his procedure but was doing well without acute issue and for this reason was discharged directly from the micu one day following admission. 


==============================================================
============================================================== brief hospital course: 1. sepsis: patient was admitted with hypotension elevated lactate(4.6) fever to 103 after an episode of nausea vomiting and witnessed aspiration at <entity>. he was treated for presumed sepsis with aggressive iv fluids and antibiotics and defervesced. his blood pressure stabilized overnight and elevated lactate resolved. mr. <name> had no further episodes of hemodynamic instability throughout the remainder of the hospital course. it was presumed his sepsis was secondary to the klebsiella in his urine and sputum. the patient was maintained on a full treatment course of vancomycin and meropenem. all antibiotics were discontinued on <date>. blood cultures were negative since <date>. he remained afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospital stay. 2. hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia s/p tracheostomy. on admission it was felt the patient had a recurrent aspiration pneumonia as he was witnessed to vomit through his tracheostomy tube. chest x-ray supported the diagnosis of lul and rll aspiration pna. on admission his prior sputum cultures were reviewd and a culture from <date> was noted to have grown klebsiella pneumonia sensitive only to meropenem. the patient was therefore started immediately on meropenem on <date>. repeat sputum culture on <date> also grew klebsiella pneumonia with multiple resistances sensitive to meropenem. he was also treated with gentamicin x 2 doses. he was noted to be hypoxic(po2 50)in the ed on trach <name> <name> he was placed on ac ventilatory support with improvement of his oxygenation. within a day the patient was weaned back to trach <name> with stable oxygen saturations. by discharge the pt was requiring only q3-4 hour suctioning. during this admission he was also fitted for a pmv ot facilitate communication. the patient was transferred to the floor on <date> for transition to <entity> for further rehab care. frequent suctioning requirement of thin clear sputum was prominently helped by application of a scopolamine patch which decreased suctioning requirement to approximately q4-6h. 3. urinary tract infection with klebsiella: urine culture from <date> grew klebsiella pneumonia. the patient was treated with meropenem for full course of antibiotics that began <date>. he should have his urinalysis repeated to document clearance of the infection. 4. history of vre bacteremia: the patient was continued on linezolid for empiric treatment of vre endocarditis for 6 week course of antibiotics given family declined tee during his <entity> admission to fully exclude endocarditis. his linezolid was discontinued on <date> after multiple negative blood cultures. this was several days shy of the full 6 week course but it was felt that linezolid may be contributing to his persistently low platelets and was not adding any further benefit. 3. fevers: the patient was treated for his klebsiella pneumonia and urinary tract infection with meropenem and his fevers resolved. the patient remained afebrile for the remainder of his hospital course after his initial febrile period. 4. cardiovascular: blood pressure: pt was hypotensive on admission in the emergency department with bp 90/60s. he was managed with agressive fluid resuscitation and transient pressure support with levophed . atrial fibrillation with history of rapid ventircular response s/p ivc filter placement: the night of admission the patient had one episode of a fib with conversion to nsr after iv metoprolol was administered. as his blood pressure improved the patient's metoprolol was titrated upwards to a dose of 75 mg tid. his heart rate remained in nsr for the remainder of his hopsital course. no anti-coagulation was indicated given his history of multiple intracranial bleeds. per neurosurgery the patient is more alert and interactive when his sbp is maintained >140. therefore his target blood pressure should be greater than 140. coronary artery disease: pt is s/p mi <date>. his enzymes were cycled on admission. he did have an enzyme leak with a peak of troponin of 0.19 and ck of 293. it was felt the leak was secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension on admission. he was treated with aspirin daily and b-blocker as tolerated. 5. hypothyroidism: the patient was continued on his daily synthroid. his tsh was 36 on <date>. his synthroid was increased from 50 mcg per day to 75 mcg per day. he should have his tsh rechecked in 1 week for appropriate response. 6. upper gi bleed: the patient was noted to have coffee ground emesis on presentation to the ed. lavage the following day was clear. gi was consulted and recommended prophylaxis with ppi and possible scope as an outpatient. prior to transfer to the floor the pt was started on sucralfate and the ppi was discontinued because of possible bone marrow suppression influencing the patient's platelet count. 7. fen: the patient's tube feeds were initially held. these were restarted on hd #3. the patient's electrolytes were monitored daily. 8. thrombocytopenia: pt has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and has a history of low platelets. his platelets slowly drifted downwards during hospital stay. it was felt that medications including linezolid and protonix may be contributing to his declining platelets. linezolid and protonix were stopped on <date> and he should be monitored for improvement in his platelet count. he di recieve a transfusion of one bag during his hospital stay. 9. depression: pt was previously on zoloft 50 mg po qd which was held due to interactions with linezolid. pt should resume zoloft at low dose and titrate up as necessary now that off linezolid. 10. code status: pt full code per family. per wife patient would want to keep fighting. 11. access: left subclavian line placed on <date> removed on transfer to medical floor on <date>. patient was stabilized with no more than q4h requirement for tracheal suctioning and was discharged to <entity> on <date>. 


==============================================================
============================================================== 1. cardiovascular: the patient was stable. 1. respiratory: the patient had multiple rib fractures. she also - at the time of initial evaluation - had bleeding from her nares and oropharynx. due to this - in combination with her decreasing mental status - she was intubated for airway protection. 1. gastrointestinal: the patient was made nothing by mouth and an og tube was placed after intubation. 1. genitourinary: a foley was placed and urine output was monitored. 1. fluids electrolytes and nutrition: she was treated with intravenous fluids initially with lactated ringer's. 1. infectious disease: kefzol was given prophylactically for her facial fractures. 1. musculoskeletal: orthopaedics was consulted for her pelvic fractures. ent oral maxillofacial surgery and ophthalmology were consulted for her facial fractures. 1. hematology: hematocrit levels and coagulations were followed. 1. prophylaxis: pneumo boots were placed for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. 1. disposition: to the intensive care unit. 1. code status: the patient was a full code at the time. again oral maxillofacial surgery saw the patient and evaluated her for the frontal bone fracture to the medial and lateral right lateral wall maxillary sinus fractures. their assessment was that surgical intervention was not warranted at the time due to the increasing edema. they also recommended an ophthalmology consultation who saw the patient out of concern for possible extraocular muscle impingement. they did not see any indication for surgical intervention at that time just close monitoring. ent was consulted for the patient's pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal bleeding which had stopped with afrin. there were no other interventions indicated. the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit intubated and the following morning had a repeat cat scan which showed worsening of her subarachnoid hemorrhage. orthopaedics saw the patient for her pelvic fractures and recommended no operative interventions and that the patient could be weightbearing as tolerated once her other issues had resolved. during the patient's intensive care unit stay she also received a mri of her spine which showed a c2 and c3 ligamentous increase intensity and her cervical spine was protected in a hard collar. additionally a l1 abnormality was seen - which was felt to be chronic; however she was kept initially on logroll precautions. to assess for possible bleeding related to her pelvic fractures she was taken to angiogram on post injury day one and this showed no sources of bleeding and there were no interventions required. on post injury day two she had enteral nutrition initiated via her og tube which she tolerated. her repeat head ct on post injury two had not showed any worsening from the post injury day one repeat ct. on neurological examination the patient had a spontaneous movement in all four extremities; however she did not follow commands. on post injury day three the patient had a questionable episode of seizure activity with arm tremors that broke after ativan administration. an electroencephalogram was performed the following day which showed no seizure foci. for coronary protection the patient was also getting lopressor at this time. she remained hemodynamically stable throughout her intensive care unit stay. on post injury day five the patient had a temperature spike and she was pan-cultured. kefzol had been continued for a total of seven days post injury for prophylaxis of sinusitis given her facial fractures per the consultants. a family meeting was held on post injury six which was attended by the <entity> healthcare proxy (which was her sister) in addition to the residents from the trauma intensive care unit and neurosurgery team as well as nursing. the patient's proxy reported that based on prior discussions with the patient that her wishes were that if she did not have any chance for a meaningful recovery she would not like to have her life prolonged with a tracheostomy or feeding tubes. the impression of her care team - including the trauma intensive care unit and neurosurgery staff - that the patient's chance for a meaningful recovery was extremely poor and we had come to the point where a tracheostomy and gastrostomy placements were indicated. the patient's family reported that they wanted to discuss it further and report their decision the following day. on post injury seven the family notified her - ms. <name> - caregivers that they wished to make her comfort measures only. she had not improved neurologically from the prior day. per the family's wishes the patient was extubated and transferred to the floor. she was made comfortable with a morphine infusion. she expired on <date> at 3:25 a.m. the patient's sister was informed and the family refused an autopsy. cause of death: blunt trauma related to a traumatic brain injury. secondary diagnoses: 1. pelvic fractures; superior and inferior pubic rami on the right. 2. iliac bone fracture on the right 3. c2 and c3 ligamentous injury. 4. l2 ligamentous injury. 5. right rib fractures (three and four). 6. facial fractures. <name> <name> <entity> dictated by:<name> medquist36 d: <date> 12:46:48 t: <date> 10:10:13 job#: <entity>

============================================================== pt. is a 23 y/o male unrestrained passenger in mva vs. stationary object on <date>. pt was combative and moving all four extremities at the scene of accident ?loc restrained and transported to <entity>. pt. was intubated and sedated in the ed. initial head ct showed open r frontal depressed comminuted skull fracture and r superior lateral orbital fracture possibly communicating. pt was stablized in the ed and transferred to the trauma sicu for monitoring. on <date> the pt. underwent the following procedures after consent was obtained: 1. bifrontal craniotomy for repair. 2. elevation of right-sided depressed skull fracture. 3. reconstruction of right-sided orbital rim. 4. reconstruction of orbital roof and posteromedial wall. 5. exenteration of frontal sinus with obliteration packing and sealing. 6. ethmoidal sinus repair with packing and sealing. 7. duraplasty. 8. plastic cranioplasty. there were no intraoperative complications and the pt. tolerated this procedure well. he was extubated in the <entity> transferred to the pacu for monitoring overnight and ultimately transferred to <name> 5 for recovery. the patient made steady progress during his stay on <name> 5 and at the time of discharge was afebrile tolerating a regular diet had a non-focal neuro exam with no new visual or sensory changes and was complaining only of a mild headache that was well controlled with oral pain medication. the pt. was instructed to follow up with dr. <name> in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head ct to continue taking his current dosing of dilantin and to stay in a c-collar at all times. 


==============================================================
============================================================== this is an 88 year old gentleman was transferred to <entity> from outside hospital status post acute anterolateral st elevation myocardial infarction complicated by several episodes of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest and was found on emergent cardiac catheterization here to have restenosis of his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent which was successfully opened with rheolytic and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapy requiring intraaortic balloon pump postprocedure. st elevation myocardial infarction - based on his electrocardiogram the patient had a large st elevation myocardial infarction. he was continued on aggrastat 24 hour postprocedure. he will require plavix therapy for nine months post left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. he will need to continue aspirin indefinitely. post cardiac catheterization the patient was continued on heparin therapy. post cardiac catheterization the patient require intraaortic balloon pump to maintain cardiac output. in addition he was requiring dopamine for blood pressure support. the patient's dopamine was weaned down over the next several days. his intraaortic balloon pump was discontinued on <date>. the patient had an echocardiogram to evaluate his myocardial function post st elevation myocardial infarction. the patient's echocardiogram documented his left atrium was mildly dilated. he had mild left ventricular hypertrophy severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum anterior wall apex distal and inferior wall hypokinesis as well. his ejection fraction was approximately 25 percent. no left ventricular aneurysm was noted and no masses or thrombi were noted in the left ventricle. based on the significant akinesis it was felt the patient would likely benefit from long term anticoagulation to prevent the risk of thrombotic embolic stroke. the team discussed with the patient's family the risks and benefits of anticoagulation given his history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. the team explained that aspirin and plavix were clearly indicated however coumadin was somewhat controversial. even with it being controversial the team did feel that he would possibly benefit from coumadin over the long term and felt that a trial of coumadin in the controlled setting of the hospital would be beneficial for the patient. after discussing this with the family the family talked with the patient and the patient was initiated on coumadin. the patient was noted to have guaiac positive stool after initiating coumadin and gastroenterology was consulted for further workup. at this point the patient's coumadin was discontinued however he was continued on aspirin and plavix. in addition in the setting of recent myocardial infarction the patient was initiated on higher dose of lipitor 80 mg p.o. once daily. he should have his liver function tests reevaluated four weeks after initiating this medication on <date>. atrial fibrillation - after discontinuing the intraaortic balloon pump the patient was noted to be in supraventricular tachycardia. electrocardiogram of this rhythm noted it to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation. the patient continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital stay which seemed to be best controlled with intravenous amiodarone. an attempt was made to transition the patient from intravenous amiodarone after significant loading to p.o. amiodarone however the patient continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation on the p.o. amiodarone. the patient's rapid atrial fibrillation was treated with metoprolol intravenously at 2.5 mg increments. this did seem to help break the patient out of his atrial fibrillation rhythm by virtue of the slower rapid ventricular response however the patient was noted to have significant sinus pauses with the use of metoprolol. his atrial fibrillation was complicated by the fact that the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with these episodes of atrial fibrillation. in addition his sinus pauses were up to five seconds when the atrial fibrillation was treated with intravenous metoprolol. therefore the patient was restarted on intravenous amiodarone therapy. the team felt that possibly his significant volume overload status was due to inability to absorb p.o. medications through his bowel wall. a plan was in place to transition the patient back to p.o. amiodarone after several days of intravenous amiodarone therapy. congestive heart failure - the patient was noted to have evidence of increased pulmonary vascular markings and peripheral edema consistent with congestive heart failure after multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation. in addition the patient had received significant volume resuscitation with his hypotension post cardiac catheterization and intraaortic balloon pump placement. it was felt that the volume resuscitation for his hypotension as well as rapid atrial fibrillation contributed to development of congestive heart failure. the patient was initially started on nesiritide drip as well as ace inhibitor for afterload reduction in the hopes of diuresis. the nesiritide was continued from <date> to <date> when the nesiritide was discontinued secondary to hypotension. at this point the patient's hypotension became a limiting factor in terms of further diuresis. however after several days his blood pressure stabilized and we were able to further diurese the patient with intravenous lasix. due to difficulty with his fluid status the patient did have a swan- ganz catheter placed after initiating coumadin <date> to have better assessment of the patient's hemodynamics. initial swan pressures showed right atrial pressure 18 right ventricular pressure 51/20 pulmonary artery pressures 55/30/44 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 35 however this was felt to be a poor wedge. repeat wedge pressures was a mean of 23. swan-ganz catheter was discontinued on <date> after significant progress had been made in his volume status. the patient was noted to have significant bilateral pleural effusions. these were tapped by interventional pulmonary service for diagnostic purposes. cultures were sent. there were no organisms and no polymorphonuclear cells on gram stain. cultures did not grow any bacteria. this was felt to be likely just a result of his congestive heart failure. gastrointestinal bleed - the patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed felt secondary to hemorrhoids based on past colonoscopy. on admission to coronary care unit he did have a nasogastric tube and was noted to have gastric occult positive nasogastric output. the patient was continued on heparin post cardiac catheterization and decision was made after speaking with the family about the benefits to initiate coumadin therapy in a controlled setting. after several days of coumadin the patient was noted to have heme positive stool. gastroenterology was consulted regarding further workup of his gastrointestinal bleeding. upper endoscopy was performed which documented three gastric erosions which were not actually bleeding but were felt to be the source of the gastrointestinal bleed. the gastroenterology team felt that given his recent st elevation myocardial infarction he was too high risk to perform lower intestinal evaluation with colonoscopy. they recommended follow-up colonoscopy in several months. the patient was empirically treated with protonix p.o. twice a day. in addition he was tested for h. pylori antigen and his h. pylori antibody was positive suggestive of active or past infection. a decision was made to hold on treating his h. pylori immediately given his multiple medical problems and concern that the patient may be at risk for aspiration with multiple p.o. tablets. however the patient should initiate h. pylori therapy prior to discharge. e. coli bacteremia - on <date> the patient had blood cultures drawn. three out of four bottles came back positive for e. coli which was resistant only to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam. the patient was started on levofloxacin immediately with the first fever spike and given the concern for infection. in addition his antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and zosyn the following day given concern that this could be multiple sources such as associated pneumonia line infection urinary tract infection. however after the blood cultures grew out e. coli the patient's antibiotics were narrowed to ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously once daily. in addition one out of four bottles grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus which was felt to be a contaminant. the patient had received several days of vancomycin which should have covered for this. on <date> the patient's vancomycin was discontinued. given the need for pacemaker placement infectious disease service was consulted regarding the duration of the antibiotic therapy. infectious disease recommended that the patient continue on ciprofloxacin for a full fourteen day course. his last day of antibiotics should be <date>. all repeat blood cultures from <date> <date> <date> <date> have been no growth to date at the time of this dictation. the source of infection was possibly secondary to bacterial translocation across the bowel wall in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding especially given multiple negative urine cultures. arrhythmia sinus pause - the patient was noted to have significant sinus pause with beta blocker treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation. the patient was noted to have junctional rhythm in the 30s after 2.5 of intravenous metoprolol as well as five second pause. decision was made to avoid further nodal blocking agents. most likely the patient will require a pacemaker for this. electrophysiology was consulted and agreed with this course of therapy. he should have a pacemaker placed prior to discharge home however this will not be done until the patient has been adequately treated with intravenous antibiotics for his e. coli bacteremia. aspiration - concern was raised regarding the patient's ability to swallow without aspiration. the patient was noted to cough on multiple occasions after eating and drinking. the patient did have a bedside swallowing evaluation on <date>. the swallowing assessment noted that the patient cleared his throat on several occasions after coughing following sips of thin liquids from the cup as well as through the straw. he was noticed to have a pill get stuck in his throat which cleared after a sip of water. however he did grimace occasionally with swallowing. bedside swallow evaluation recommended that the patient have a video swallow to definitively rule out aspiration and make safe diet recommendations. in the meantime the patient was continued on nectar thick liquids with cups of only pureed solids. the patient's seemed to be tolerating this well. he should have a video swallow prior to discharge. please see discharge summary addendum for remainder of hospital course discharge status and discharge medications. <name> <name> md <entity> dictated by:<name> medquist36 d: <date> 16:05:13 t: <date> 11:02:55 job#: <entity>

============================================================== neuro: the patient was transferred intubated and sedated on the ventilator. throughout his hospital course he had daily wake-ups through the sedation and pain medication. early in his course he awoke very agitated and not following commands though was alert looking around the room and moving all extremities with equal and reactive pupils. he had a history of alcohol use and had experienced dt's in the past with withdrawal. consequently he was maintained on a versed drip and much of the confusion was attributed to possible withdrawal in addition to delerium. with re-evaluation by wake-ups the patient slowly became more attentive and did not have tremors/shakes was following commands and communicated that he was not in any discomfort. after extubation a full neuro exam was normal including strength/sensation cranial nerves dtrs cerebellar exam and speech/memory. heent: the patient was noted to have poor dentition but no signs of abscess/infection on oral exam. in addition a ct scan of his head was normal and showed no signs of sinusitis. pulmonary: his active problems during this admission were respiratory failure pneumonia pleural effusion. the main concern for this patient was that of pneumonia and strep pneumonia grew in the first sputum culture on admission. he was noted to have a large r pleural effusion which was tapped but did not show evidence of empyema. he remained on the ventilator for 17 days. upon extubation he did well had minimal secretions and strong cough o2 sats in the 90's work of breathing was easy. cardiac: active issues during this admission included hypotension and atrial fibrillation with a history of cad and chf. the hypotension was not fluid responsive and he required levophed pressor support for the first 15 days of hospitalization. this was weened off and he was eventually restarted on all of his home htn medication. the hypotension was felt to be sepsis physiology without evidence of new mycardial injury. the atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled and at first anticoagulation was held <date> a supratherapeutic inr. this came down to normal levels and a heparin drip was started and he is being bridged back onto coumadin. in terms of his chf an echo revealed only mildly depressed lvef at 40-50% and specifics are listed in the report above. gi/fen: patient was aggressively volume resuscitated early on being at the highest 27 liters positive on his i/o's. this eventually was diuresed to a slightly positive volume status and he will go to rehab with continued diureses. he was started on tube feeds with help from the nutritionists and will be going to rehab taking po. renal/gu: the patient came to the service with mildly reduced renal function. upon receiving his ct his renl function deteriorated and was felt to have contrast nephropathy. over the next week this resolved to his baseline.he responded well to lasix and metolazone diuresis as described above. heme/id: active issues included elevated inr (as described above) and positive cultures included strep pneumonia on sputum and 1/2 bottles of gpc bacteremia. his antibiotic course intially was broad including levaquin ceftriaxone vancomycin and zosyn (broad plus double coverage). this was tailored down to ceftriaxone to cover the strep pneumonia that was speciated from the sputum. the patient started requiring slightly higher pressor support 1.5 weeks into admission started spiking nocturnal fevers and subsequently grew the coag negative staph. he was broadened again for this though was felt this was likely contaminant. his fever curve and white count normalized and the course of antibiotics was d/c'd. he also developes some diarrhea but c.diff was negative x 3 (got po flagyl until negative cx came back) prophylaxis: remained on sch then hep gtt/coumadin pneumoboots and ppi code: remained full code throughout dispo: discharge to rehab facility

==============================================================
============================================================== 1. respiratory failure: the patient exhibited hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of unclear etiology. hypoxic respiratory failure improved with diuresis. the patient was diuresed with lasix and natrecor to a total of negative five liters which seemed to improve his congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and by physical examination and seemed to improve his hypoxic respiratory failure. many factors were considered to be at play in his hypercapnic respiratory failure including congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction causing large bilateral pleural effusions with some pulmonary edema muscle weakness and likely obstructive sleep apnea with some central hypoventilation syndrome. abg's were obtained q. 3h. to evaluate the patient's acid base status on and off noninvasive ventilation in addition to awake and asleep. the patient's ph ranged from 7.4 to 7.32 and his pco2 ranged from 55 to 82 though there did not seem to be much of a correlation between whether he was on noninvasive ventilation and whether he was on face mask. it is most likely that the patient's hypercapnia is due to his obstructive sleep apnea and thus treating the obstructive sleep apnea is the best way to address this problem. therefore the patient was started on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation overnight with a pressure of 8 starting on <date>. as the patient began to wake up and become less somnolent he also began to refuse his full face mask for noninvasive ventilation however he did do quite well on two liter nasal cannula for most of the day. the patient was at many times noted to be extremely somnolent and unresponsive however his somnolence did not correlate with his pco2 levels therefore it was thought not to be due to hypercapnic toxicity but due to his obstructive sleep apnea and extremely large sleep deficit. in addition the patient was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis thought to be secondary to contraction alkalosis and he was given supplemental potassium chloride and three doses of acetazolamide in order to improve his metabolic alkalosis and thereby increase his drive to breathe. in addition the patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal cannula in order to maintain his sat no less than 88% and no greater than 93% in order to maintain his drive to breathe. in addition the patient underwent bilateral thoracentesis which yielded 1400 cc of serosanguinous fluid from either side. the chemistries from the left revealed a ph of 7.42 a ldh of 193 and a total protein of 2.14. the chemistries from the right revealed an ldh of 197 and a total protein of 2.3. both of the thoracenteses were thought to be transudative in nature. the patient did seem to improve his respiratory status after thoracentesis. in addition the patient was rate controlled on beta blockers in order to treat his diastolic dysfunction with the hopes of improving his respiratory status. the patient's olanzapine was also discontinued with the thought that it may be decreasing his drive to breath. 2. cardiac: the patient was initially found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission but self-converted to normal sinus rhythm. throughout his stay the patient did continue to have paroxysmal bursts of atrial fibrillation some of which were thought by cardiology consult to actually be supraventricular tachycardias. the patient was continued on his lopressor and the doses titrated up in order to maintain normal sinus rhythm and the patient did have decreased episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with no episodes of atrial fibrillation during the last few days of his intensive care unit stay. cardiology consult was obtained and did not recommend anticoagulation for the patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. ectopy: the patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which resolved with increased beta blocker doses and did not recur during his hospital stay. 4. diastolic dysfunction. the patient had an ejection fraction of 60% with severe diastolic dysfunction which was treated with lasix as needed and now that the patient is uvolemic is being treated with metoprolol for rate control. 5. coronary artery disease: the patient has three vessel coronary artery disease and an appointment for cardiac catheterization after discharge. the patient is receiving aspirin metoprolol and captopril. 6. fluids electrolytes and nutrition: the patient's nutrition status was addressed several times during this hospitalization. the patient was taking full breakfasts but no other meals during his stay. it was decided not to give the patient an ng tube as that would interfere with his use of the noninvasive ventilation therefore it was planned for a midline catheter in order to give the patient tpn. 7. infectious disease: the patient initially had a low grade temperature of 100 on <date>. all subsequent blood cultures and urine cultures were negative. the patient was treated with levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia which was discontinued on <date> as a repeat chest x-ray showed no signs of infectious infiltrate. 8. hematology: the patient had mild proliferative disorder and his complete blood count was followed throughout this hospital stay. <name> <name> m.d. <entity> dictated by:<name>
